# Listener Management
Use **Cobalt Strike -> Listeners**

Types of listeners :

- `egress` is a payload that beacons out of a network
- `peer-to-peer` is a payload that communicates through a parent payload (primary use for pivoting)
- `alias` is a reference to a payload handler elsewhere (e.g. in another toolset)

Types of payload

| Payloads      | Type of listener | Starger?        | Note     |
| ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | -------- |
| Beacon DNS    | egress           | reverse_dns_txt |          |
| Beacon HTTP   | egress           | reverse_http    |          |
| Beacon HTTPS  | egress           | reverse_https   |          |
| Beacon SMB    | peer-to-peer     |                 | bind     |
| Beacon TCP    | peer-to-peer     |                 | bind     |
| External C2   | other            |                 |          |
| Foreign HTTP  | alias            | reverse_http    | x86 only |
| Foreign HTTPS | alias            | reverse_https   | x86 only |
#Payload-Staging
- **`Stager`** a tiny program that download a payload and passes execution to it. Needed for size-contrained attacks
- **`Stageless`** means payload without a stager
- Stagers are:
	- less secure
	- more brittle
	- easie to detect

# Beacon Payload
- HTTP and HTTP Beacon
- DNS Beacon
- SMB and TCP Beacon
- External C2
