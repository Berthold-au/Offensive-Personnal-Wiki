A bug bounty program (also called a `vulnerability rewards program` - VRP)

## Writing a Good Report

> Most importantly, bug reports should include information on how exploitation of each vulnerability can be reproduced step-by-step.

The essential elements of a good bug report are (the element order can vary):

**Report**

- `Vulnerability Title` : Including vulnerability type, affected domain/parameter/endpoint, impact etc.

- `CWE & CVSS score` : For communicating the characteristics and severity of the vulnerability.[Using CVSS Calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1)

- `Vulnerability Description` : Better understanding of the vulnerability cause.

- `Impact` : Elaborate more on what an attacker can achieve by fully exploiting the vulnerability. Business impact and maximum damage should be included in the impact statement.

- `Proof of Concept (POC)` : Steps to reproduce exploiting the identified vulnerability clearly and concisely.

- `Remediation` : Optional in bug bounty programs, but good to have.

## Interacting with Organizations/BBP Hosts

Suppose that you have submitted a bug report. How should you interact with the security/triage team after that?

- Well, to begin with, `do not interact with them`. Allow the security/triage team some time to process your report, validate your finding, and maybe ask questions.

- If the security/triage team does not get back to you in a reasonable amount of time, then if the submission was through a bug bounty platform, you can contact [Mediation](https://docs.hackerone.com/hackers/hacker-mediation.html).

- Once the security/triage team gets back to you, note the team member's username and tag them in any future communications since they will probably be dealing with your submission.
